# Updated-Router-Project
## Description
This is a single page application that provides information about ground school, a sign in page, pricing and blog.

## How to Run
Open the files using a local server to run. I like the terminal command npm install -- global http-server.

## Roadmap of future improvements
I would like to find a way to make the "gnome screen" a button. The current issue is that when I make it a button instead of class="nav-link active" and click, the navbar is duplicated below.
